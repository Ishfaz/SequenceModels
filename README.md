# Sequence Models Lab

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for solving the parity task. The lab is designed to demonstrate the application of these sequence models in determining whether the number of ones in a sequence of bits is odd or even.

## Objectives
- **Vanilla RNN Implementation**: Implement a basic RNN model to understand the fundamentals of recurrent neural processing.
- **LSTM Utilization**: Extend the implementation to Long Short-Term Memory networks to tackle the limitations of vanilla RNNs.
- **Parity Task**: Apply both models to a parity task, where the goal is to predict whether the count of ones in the input sequence is even or odd.
- **Training Dynamics Analysis**: Explore how different training setups (e.g., loss computation at each timestep vs. the final timestep) influence the learning process.
